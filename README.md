# Flocking
Flocking simulator loosley based off of flocking behaviour algorithm

## Things to change/fix
1. Separation needs to be improved
2. Nodes can glitch out when travelling at a steep angle near edge
3. Perhaps add sliders to change strength of sepoeration, alighment, cohest, number of nodes etc.
